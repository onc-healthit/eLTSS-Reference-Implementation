# eLTSS-Reference-Implementation

This initiative is an ONC-CMS partnership focusing on the identification and harmonization of electronic standards that can enable the creation, exchange and re-use of interoperable service plans for use by health care and community-based long-term services and supports providers, payers and the individuals they serve. These plans can help to improve the coordination of health and social services that support an individualâ€™s mental and physical health.

This reference implementation is for the eLTSS FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) Release 1 - US Realm.
